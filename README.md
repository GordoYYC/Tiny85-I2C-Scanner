# Tiny85-I2C-Scanner
Beginner: Project to scan I2C bus and report on LCD (also I2C) all the I2C addresses found.

Easily adapted to Ardinos, etc., but should hopefully help beginners get their AT Tiny 85's up and talking to the world.

A couple things I had difficulty with was getting a standard LCD (with backpack I2C adaptor) working with the Tiny, as I had to find a suitable library (in the future I'll be able to write my own libraries, but gotta walk before I run).
